# Statistical Regression

#### What does it do?

With this statistical regression calculator, you can supply datapoints (x and y values) and it will give you the line that best fits those datapoints.

Right now, there is only Linear Regression capability, so it will only work with the formula y=mx+b. However, I plan to add many other regression formulas (such as quadratic regression, exponential regression, power regression, etc.) in the future.

#### How do I use it?

For each point in your dataset, enter the point as "x,y" into the program. When you are done entering points, enter "done". When you run the program, it will calculate the line that best fits your data and print it to the command line. Pretty cool!

#### Known bugs:

Currently, the only known bugs are that the program will raise an error if the number of elements in x and y are different, or if there are invalid characters entered in the data. To fix: make sure that the x array and y array have the same number of elements and that there are no invalid characters entered.
