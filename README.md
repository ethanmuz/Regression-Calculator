# Statistical Regression

#### What does it do?

With this statistical regression calculator, you can supply datapoints (x and y values) and it will give you the line that best fits those datapoints.

Right now, there is only Linear Regression capability, so it will only work with the formula y=mx+b. However, I plan to add many other regression formulas (such as quadratic regression, exponential regression, power regression, etc.) in the future.

#### How do I use it?

Right now, you have to edit the arrays in the Main class (make sure that both x and y arrays have the same number of elements!) with your data. When you run the program, it will calculate the line that best fits your data and print it to the command line. Pretty cool!

Soon, I will add the ability to submit your data from the command line.

#### Known bugs:

Currently, the only known bug is that the program will raise an error if the number of elements in x and y are different. To fix: make sure that the x array and y array have the same number of elements.
